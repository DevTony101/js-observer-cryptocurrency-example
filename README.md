An example project made for a tutorial introducing the **Observer Design Pattern**, in which we build a simple alert system
where users can subscribe to a particular currency and they will be _notified_ when the price changes.

If you came for the tutorial and want to code along, download the starting code [here](https://github.com/DevTony101/js-observer-cryptocurrency-example/releases/tag/starting-code).
